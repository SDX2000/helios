- lib/kruntime/src/rt/deh.d contains code to handle D exceptions using the windows SEH mechanism hence it is not 
required at the moment and has been renamed to deh.d_ to exclude it from the build

- upgrade kruntime to dmd v2.056 (please remember to use the same version of phobos when trying to compile phobos 
for the kernel)
- Compile libdruntime.a with newlib
- Link kernel with libdruntime.d and remove the _Dmodule_ref kludge
- Reimplement all C files in D
- Once we have a working bare kernel using druntime + newlib rework the druntime to remove the need for an underlying C library.

 REJECTED
==========

- Change code in update_image.sh and run_bochs.sh so that root previleges are not required. REASON: This is by design, 
non root users cannot mount loopback devices in linux.

1. Directory structure reorg.
    a. obj/[config] - all intermediates go here
    b. lib/[config] - all libraries go here
    c. out - the kernel image is generated here
    d. img - disk images are kept here
